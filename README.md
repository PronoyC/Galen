# Galen

Galen is a web application that tracks and regulates opioid prescriptions on the blockchain and aims to address the opioid epidemic currently present in our society.

The opioid epidemic is a serious issue present in today's day and age and contributed to over 10,300 deaths within the last 3 years in Canada and even more so in the US with over 100,000 deaths in the past 3 years alone (over 700,000 deaths since the late 90s). (https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html) (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2019/04/updated-numbers-on-opioid-related-overdose-deaths-in-canada.html)

Currently, the Government of Canada is not doing anything tangible to combat this issue and therefore, our goal is limit drug abuse using Galen.

This is what we have built out so far:

Pharmacies can upload prescriptions from clinics and add them to Galen to track opioid distributions. Galen can also review the history of a patient and our model determines whether the patient is safe to give opioids to or not. All of this information is stored onto the Blockchain and also utilizes Google Cloud Vision to analyze the prescriptions.

Police have access to the solution as well, being able to add overdose reports to the blockchain. With all this information in mind, we can generate heatmaps of overdose density and use our AI algorithm to find the best area to set up relief centres and provide naxolene, the anti-overdosing drug. We can also highlight clinics in these areas and provide them with naxolene, making it easier for first responders to administer the drug.

Ultimately, Galen strives to finally address the Opioid epidemic in a tangible manner.
